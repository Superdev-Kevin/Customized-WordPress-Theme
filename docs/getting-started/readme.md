# Getting Started

This chapter will cover making a simple module from start to finish in four key sections. The goal is to introduce key Flynt concepts whilst still leaving you with a usable module at the end of each section.

* [1. Creating a Basic Module](basic-module)
* [2. Adding ACF Fields and Manipulating Data](dynamic-module)
* [3. Adding Assets to a Module; Styles, Scripts, and Images](module-assets)
* [4. Tutorial Recap and Further Reading](recap.md)
