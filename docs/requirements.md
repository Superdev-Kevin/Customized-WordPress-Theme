# Requirements
There are two main options when it comes to setting up the Flynt Theme. You can handle the setup with existing tools, or set everything up yourself.

Either way, the minimum requirements are:

- Node (version?)
- Composer
- Yarn / NPM (version?)
- PHP (version?)
- MySQL (version?)
- PHPCS (optional - if you want to test / for developing the boilerplate | theme only)

## Setup with existing tools
Using any of the below tools will take care of installing these requirements for you:

#### [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/)
#### [Scotchbox](https://box.scotch.io/)
