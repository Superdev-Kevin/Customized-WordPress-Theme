# Using Flexible Content with ACF Pro

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p><strong>To use the flexible content field you must have purchased and installed the Advanced Custom Fields Pro plugin. <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/">You can purchase this on the ACF website here.</a></strong></p>

**[We strongly recommend that you first learn how the `dynamicSubcomponents` filter works. Read more about this here](dynamic-subcomponents.md)** 

To quote the official ACF documentation:

> The Flexible content field acts as a blank canvas to which you can add an unlimited number of layouts with full control over the order.

[You can read more here](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/flexible-content-field/).

With Flynt, this field is truly powerful when we consider that every component can be registered as a separate flexible content layout. The user will then be free to drag and drop each component on their page to create their own unique layouts. Since every component is self-contained, the final output order on the front-end is irrelevant (in almost all cases).
