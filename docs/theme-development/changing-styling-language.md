# Changing the Styling Language

- You do not need to use Stylus.
- Can also just use vanilla CSS file in Component folder and it will copy the file.
- For SASS, recommend using [Gulp SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass).
- For LESS, recommend [Gulp LESS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-less).
- Add example/tutorial here for how to change to SASS, as an example.
